        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>75g egg or rice noodles</li>
            <li>mixed stir fry vegetables (I used pepper, broccoli, carrot and onion)</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>1 small piece of ginger</li>
            <li>1 spring onion</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>vegetable oil (for cooking)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Grab a medium sized pan, add water and get it on the heat to boil. Add the noodles and cook following
                the timings onthe back of the packet.</li>
            <li>Slice up all the vegetables that you want to include into strips or chunks. You're also going to need to
                chop up thegarlic and ginger.</li>
            <li>Put a frying pan (or a wok if you've got one) on a high heat and add a drizzle of oil. Throw in the
                garlic and gingerand let it sizzle for a minute before throwing in the rest of the veggies. Cook until
                the vegetables have softened (probably going to take about 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Drain the cooked noodles and add them to the pan with the vegetables. Add a splash of soy sauce and mix
                it all up.</li>
        </ol>
